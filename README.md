# Air Crashes since 1908 Visualization Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Air Crashes Visualization Project! This project aims to provide comprehensive insights into air crash incidents from historical data. Using interactive visualizations, we delve into trends, patterns, and crucial factors contributing to air crashes. Our goal is to make this data accessible and understandable, aiding in better safety protocols and awareness.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Four key visualizations provide diverse perspectives on the data:
    1. **Stacked Bar Chart:** Showcase trends in air crashes over the years, highlighting specific periods with high incident rates.
    2. **Pie Chart:** Illustrates the proportion of fatalities versus survivors in air crashes.
    3. **Geographical Map:** Displays geographical patterns, pinpointing regions with higher incidences.
    4. **Treemap:** Compares aircraft models involved in crashes, indicating potential model-specific safety issues.

- **User Interactivity:** Users can interact with the data through features like brushing in the bar chart and clicking elements in the map and treemap.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Analysis of historical data provides insights into improvements in air travel safety and regional risk factors.

## Tools and Technologies
- **D3.js:** For creating dynamic, interactive visualizations.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** For the webpage structure, styling, and functionality.
- **GeoJSON:** For geographical data rendering in the map.
- **GitHub Pages:** Hosting the visualization presentation.
